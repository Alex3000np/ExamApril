### Weekly feedback evaluator
Write a method which can read and parse a file containing information about
weekly feedback from apprentices about a mentor.
The mentor is *rated* in 4 different metrics, those are respectively
(*`matReview`*, *`presSkills`*, *`helpfulness`*, *`explanation`*) separated with 1 space:
- m = `matReview`
- p = `presSkills`
- h = `helpfulness`
- e = `explanation`
```text
m p h e   // this is just an info line which is not in the actual file
1 3 5 3   // this line is an answer from an apprentice
2 3 4 3   // this is another response
...
The method should return a map/dictionary containing the average rating
(in each metric) of the mentor.

#### Example
[Example file can be found here.](./responses.txt)
Output
```js
{
  "matReview": 2.25,
  "presSkills": 4.0, // or 4 is fine as well
  "helpfulness": 4.5,
  "explanations": 3.75
}

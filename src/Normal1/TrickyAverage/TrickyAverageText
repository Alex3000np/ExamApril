Tricky Average
Create and test a function called getTrickyAvg that takes an array as parameter and returns the
average of the
smallest odd (1,3,5,7,9,...) and largest even (2,4,6,8,10,...).

If there is no odd/even number then use 0 instead (take a look at Example 3 for better understanding).

You can use streams; however, if you do, we will ask you to verbally explain the
functionality behind the methods to a
mentor. Itâ€™s important that you know how streams work if you are going to use them.
You should be able to solve this
task with concepts we showed you in foundation.

Write at least 2 different unit tests, one that tests normal operation and one that tests
unexpected input.

Example 1
Input
[3, 4, 5, 6]
Output
(3+6)/2=4.5
Example 2
Input
[5, 2, 8, -1]
Output
(-1+8)/2=3.5
Example 3
Input
[5, 7, 9, 11]
Output
(5+0)/2=2.5

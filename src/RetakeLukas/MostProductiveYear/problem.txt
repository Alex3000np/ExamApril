Most productive year
We have a very simple database consisting of only csv files (comma separated values).
Write a method called mostProductiveYear() which can read and parse a file containing
information about movies. This method takes one argument, which is the name of the film
studio and returns the most productive year for the film studio. The most productive year
is a year in which studio produced the highest number of movies.

If we do not have any data about the studio, the method returns an error message
"Cannot find studio --studio name--, please try again later."

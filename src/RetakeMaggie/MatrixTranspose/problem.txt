Algorithm exercise: Matrix transpose
Create a function that takes a matrix as a parameter and returns the
transpose of that matrix.
The original matrix should remain the same. Keep in mind that the matrices
might not be square-shaped.
It could be 4x3, 6x1, etc... You can get some points if it works for square
matrices but it needs to work for non-square matrices for full points.

Write at least 2 different unit test cases.

Example 1
Input
[
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9]
]
Output
[
  [1, 4, 7],
  [2, 5, 8],
  [3, 6, 9]
]

Example 2
Input
[
  [5, 9, 3, 7],
  [3, 2, 1, 8]
]
Output
[
  [5, 3],
  [9, 2],
  [3, 1],
  [7, 8]
]
